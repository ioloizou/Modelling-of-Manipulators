# Modelling of Manipulators Lab Assignments

This repository contains lab assignments completed for the Modelling of Manipulators course as part of my Master's program in Advanced Robotics at Centrale Nantes.

## Overview

The labs in this repository focus on various topics covered in the course, like Direct Geometric Modelling, Inverse Geometric Modelling with Analytical and Numerical methods, Trajectory Generation and Velocity Control of the robot.

## Contents

- `robot_turret.cpp` - Modelling of the turret robot
- `robot_kr16.cpp` - Modelling of the KUKA kr16 robot
- `robot_ur10.cpp` - Modelling of the UR10 robot
- `control.cpp` - All the different execution methods

## Visuals

Below are some key visuals from the lab assignments to illustrate the results and methodologies.

## How to Use

This repository is for showcasing purposes. To explore the code and reports:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ioloizou/modelling-of-manipulators.git
```

Feel free to browse through each lab folder to view the detailed documentation and code for each assignment. 
If you don't have the university VM you will not be able to run it as you will be missing many dependecies.
